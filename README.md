## Overview
Since the introduction of e-commerce into the Nigerian economy in the last decade, there have been significant growth in the logistics sector. Prior to the invent of e-commerce, the logistics sector in Nigeria was being dominated by largely major transport companies with much physical interaction between sender and carrier. However, e-commerce created a new model of way-billing items, goods from one point to the other as there were significant growth in way-billing, as such smaller logistics firms emerged and grew. The gradual cultural shift has evolved so much so that a large number of Nigerians have come to trust cashless services. Hence, the likes of Opay, SafeBoda and other tech startups are growing steadily. 
<br/>
<br/>
Thus, CariGo which is a decentralized Logistics as a Platform application is poised to positively disrupt organized way of way-billing items between two locations in a more efficient manner. Here, **the Carrier is typically going in the said location** and thus would make passive income alongside while helping to move the item to the said location in record time without much prior planning as its obtainable in traditional processes. Thus solving the issue of excess vehicles plying our weak roads, reduce carbon footprint; while providing reliable, insured, quick and efficient services.
